Description:
	- Awesome Unicorns is a reverse tower defence game where you are tasked with overcoming increasingly difficult
	  odds by attempting to have enough unicorns reach the end of the level. Each level you will have a set
	  amount of money with which to purchase your unicorns and a certain number of unicorns which need to
	  reach the end of the level. It is up to YOU to determine which set of minions down which paths will
	  assure victory and allow you to advance to the next level, eventually leading to the fourth and final level.

Controls:
	- Navigate the menus with the arrow keys or wasd.
	- Select an option using the space key.
	- During minion selection: press 'h' to bring up a help menu, press 'enter' to start the level
	  with your currently purchased minions, or press 'q' to return to the main menu.
	- During the simulation: use the left and right arrow keys to speed and slow down the game, respectively.

Running the Game:
	- Compile with command "make" from the main directory.
	  - Alternatively, use the command "make cleanBuild" from the main directory to remove all '.o' and '.bin' files.
	- Run with command "./bin/awesomeUnicorns" from the main directory.
	- If it appears as though the game is not fully visible, resize the terminal window until you see a black border
	  around the rest of the white content.
